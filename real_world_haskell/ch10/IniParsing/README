This is a practice for me to be familiar with the though on implicit state
processing by parsing a simplified windows ini format.

The format is like:
# A comment
# another comment

[Section] # case sensitive, and each section should be unique
          # spaces between brackets and section name are ignored.

# A option is also case sensitive, and each option in a setion should be
# unique.
# But different sections can have options with same name.
option0 = some value
