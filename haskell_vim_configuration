The author of the question said:
Just in case someone stumbles over this question in the future. My current (haskell specific) vim configuration contains these plugins: ghcmod-vim (type exploring), neco-ghc (auto completion), syntactic (error highlighting), vim2hs (misc utils) â€“  Florian Dec 17 '13 at 14:29 


The author of haskellmode-vim does not maintain that vim plugin anymore.
And I should try the plugins mentioned above.
