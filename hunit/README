This code is part of a tutorial about using HUnit (a unit testing tool
for Haskell). The text of the tutorial can be found at 

  http://leiffrenzel.de/papers/getting-started-with-hunit.html

To run the test cases, open a terminal and type

  ghci FindIdentifier_Test
  *FindIdentifier_Test>main

Have fun :-)
